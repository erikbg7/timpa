It does not include aggregated or de-identified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.

## Our Collection of Personal Information

Sometimes we collect Personal Information automatically when an individual interacts with our Services and sometimes we collect Personal Information directly from an individual. At times, we may collect Personal Information about an individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction.

**Personal Information Collected from Site Visitors and Account Holders:**

We may collect the following Personal Information submitted to us by visitors to our Site and account holders:

- Contact Information, including name, email address, mailing address, employer, job tile, company name, phone number and communication preferences.
- Inquiry Information, including information provided in custom messages sent through the forms or contact information provided on our Site.
- Account Information, including name, company name, employer, job title, email address, username and password, profile information, payment and purchase history information, and any other information you provide to us. Please note we utilize a third-party provider to process payments on our behalf and do not accept payment directly through our Site.

As is true of most digital platforms, we and our third-party providers may also collect Personal Information from an individual’s device, browsing actions and site usage patterns automatically when visiting or interacting with our Site, which may include log data (such as internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser id, the URL entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, the time spent on our Site and any errors that may occur during the visit to our Site), analytics data (such as the electronic path taken to our Site, through our Site and when exiting our Site, as well as usage and activity on our Site) and location data (such as general geographic location based on the log data we or our third-party providers collect). We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “cookies”) to automatically collect this Personal Information. For example, our Site uses Datadog is a monitoring service provided by Datadog, Inc. (“Datadog”), to collect and view reports about the traffic on our Site. More information about the use of Datadog for these analytical and non-advertising purposes can be obtained by visiting Datadog’s privacy policy here. To manage cookies, an individual may change their browser settings to: (i) notify them when they receive a cookie, so the individual can choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact an individual’s experience using our Site, as some features and offerings may not work properly or at all. Depending on an individual’s device and operating system, the individual may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if an individual wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the individual will need to do so on each browser on each device they actively use. An individual may also set their email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether they have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it. For more information about these practices in relation to our European operations, please see the “Cookies and Similar Technologies Used on Our Site” section of the Privacy Disclosures for the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland below.
